# My-Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done. As well as some certificates  that I have achieved to be able to realize them.

In pursuit of find a reliable method to determine when a person could have heart disease a dataset with various parameters related to heart health was downloaded and several methods of Machine Learning were applied to it, in order to determine their reliability, the accuracy of each one was computed.

Evaluation of different models of Machine Learning in order to find the most accurate to preddict the price of a car using a dataset which was cleaned for proper operation.

This was my very first project. I used my skills in python with pandas in a very huge dataset of trees census in order to make it smaller and easier to read. Specifically I managed to clean the data of dead trees or not healthy.
